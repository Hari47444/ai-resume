        <span class="v213_414 grbody">
          A resume is a brief document with a collection of achievements in
          professional, academic, and personal areas that serves to represent
          you in a job hunt—a formal display of opportunities you've taken for a
          better future. It showcases your skill set and experience to a
          prospective employer. A resume is typically formatted into sections
          and sent alongside a cover letter.

          Do you want to land more job interviews? The easiest way to achieve
          this is by attracting a recruiter’s attention straight away by
          summarizing the highlights of your career right at the start of your
          resume — in a section called the resume summary.
          <br />
          <br />
          The purpose of this resume section, which is also known as a
          professional summary or resume statement, is to create a good first
          impression. It sums up your work experience, skills, and achievements
          into a short and concise sales pitch where you are the product.
          <br />
          <br />
          Do it well, and your future employers will be more inclined to read
          the rest of your resume.
          <br />
          <br />
          Without further ado, let’s show you how to write an exceptional
          professional summary that will not only get you more job interviews

          A professional summary gives the hiring manager a quick overview of

          of your resume. <br />
          <br />
          It sits at the top of your resume, beneath your name and contact

          resume.
          <br />
          <br /> It should sum up your top skills, experiences, and achievements
          as they pertain to the job description.

            How long should a professional summary be?
          </span>{" "}
          <br />
          <br /> Generally speaking, a resume summary should be quite short. The
          most common length is 3-5 sentences or bullet points. It shouldn't be
          longer than 5-6 concise bullet points, but it also shouldn't be
          shorter than 2 bullet points.
          <br />
          <br />
          You can also replace the first bullet point with a short introductory
          paragraph that includes your job title, years of experience, and
          specialization.

        <span class="v226_467">
          Why do you need a professional summary?
          <br />
          <br /> While many people still don't include the resume profile
          section in their resumes, it's a mistake. But why is it a mistake?
          <br />
          <br /> 01 You want to grab the recruiter's attention from the get-go.
          02 You'll make their life a bit easier because you'll immediately tell
          them who you are.
          <br />
          <br />
          The thing is, recruiters are busy people, they go through dozens,
          sometimes hundreds of resumes before they can find a few qualified
          candidates.
          <br />
          <br />
          Do you know what this means? Shortcuts. At first, recruiters will be
          skimming resumes in search of specific keywords and phrases that align
          with what the company is searching for.
          <br />
          <br />
          That’s why you want to include the best resume summary you can come up
          with because a good summary section consists of nothing but these
          juicy bite-size phrases and keywords that a recruiter can spot at a
          glance. <br />
          <br />
          In short, a professional summary allows you to turn a recruiter's time
          limitation into an advantage.

            How to write a resume summary if you're a fresh graduate/student?
          </span>
          <br />
          <br />
          If you’re a student or a fresh graduate, you probably don’t have much
          to brag about in your resume yet.
          <br />
          <br />
          But that’s true only to some extent. Even as an entry-level candidate,
          you already have at least some experience and skills. You just have to
          find the right way to articulate them.
          <br />
          <br />
          What’s more, it’s quite likely that the other candidates are just as
          inexperienced as you are. After all, experienced professionals rarely
          apply for entry-level positions.
          <br />
          <br />
          Because of that, your primary goal is to stand out and make the
          employer remember you. And you can do that even if your experience is
          limited.
          <br />
          <br />
          It’s not like you’ve just spent most of your life at school and
          learned nothing. You just need to understand how your studies
          intersect with the job’s requirements. <br />
          <br />
          Here’s how you can write your professional resume summary as a
          student/fresh graduate:
          <br />
          <br />
          1. State your field of study, degree, and GPA (if it’s above 3.0).
          <br />
          2. Mention relevant skills gained in internships, part-time jobs, and
          volunteer work.
          <br />
          3. Add related coursework or school projects.
          <br />
          Also, try to translate your most notable achievements into numbers.
          Maybe you were on the student council. You can mention how you
          received 800 votes and helped organize 5 large school events that were
          attended by 2,000 students.
          <br />

          In the end, a fresh graduate resume summary should look a bit like
          this:
          <br />
          <br />

          Final tips and tricks
          <br />
          <br />
          We've already mentioned almost everything you need to write an
          effective professional summary. These are some of the final tips that
          didn't fit anywhere else in this guide:
          <br />
          <br />
          1. Emphasize proven experience. Instead of simply listing your skills,
          mention your previous accomplishments. For example, it’s much more
          impactful to say that you had your articles published in Forbes than
          to plainly claim that you’re a skilled writer.
          <br />
          2. Try to avoid using the word “I”. It's not really necessary,
          especially if you write in bullet points.
          <br />
          3. Structure it well. Take it from a professional writer — bullet
          points are a godsend when you need to structure your text clearly
          without giving it too much effort. Not only will they naturally order
          your resume statement into clearly delineated logical parts, but
          they'll also make it look good and read well. Also, make sure to write
          your current job title in bold.
          <br />
          4. Keep it short. Your summary shouldn’t be longer than 5 short
          sentences (or bullet points). Having a long summary sort of defeats
          the point of having a resume summary at all. Don’t add random things.
          The key is to be specific.
          <br />
          5. Read it after yourself. When you’re finished writing, read through
          your summary from the perspective of a hiring manager, asking “Why
          should we hire you?”.
