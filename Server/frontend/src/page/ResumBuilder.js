          What is a resume?
        </span>
         <span class="v93_664 grbody">
           A resume is a brief document with a collection of
          achievements in professional, academic, and personal areas that serves
          to represent you in a job hunt—a formal display of opportunities
          you've taken for a better future. It showcases your skill set and
          experience to a prospective employer. A resume is typically formatted
          into sections and sent alongside a cover letter.
