        Should I use a resume example or not?</span>
        
        <br/>
        <br/>
         By using a ready-made resume
        example written by career and Human Resources experts, you can be sure
        your resume will meet the current HR standards. If you choose not to use
        a resume sample, you will waste a lot of time writing a resume on your
        own – while you could use this time to write a cover letter, or prepare
        for the job interview instead. You also risk making mistakes on your
        resume that can kill your chances of getting that job.</span

          >When copying a resume sample for your job application, all you need
          to do is pay attention to the contact, work experience, and education
          details. If you have different skills than those included in the
          resume example, be sure to replace them and list your skills on your
          resume the right way. The more complex your job history is, the more
          you'll need to adjust the resume sample. While you can keep most of
          the information from our ready resume examples, we encourage you to
          read our guide on all resume sections, so that you can be sure all
          parts of your resume have the right information presented in the right

         Sending
        the same generic resume to all companies is a huge no-no. Recruiters and
        hiring managers will spot it immediately, and it will significantly
        lower your chances of getting a job interview invite. We strongly
        recommend that you tailor your resume to every application. Note that in
