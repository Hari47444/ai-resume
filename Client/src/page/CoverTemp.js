          What is a cover letter for a resume?
        </span>

        <span class="v239_415">
          A cover letter for a resume is a
          document attached to your job application that will support your
          resume by explaining your motivation and providing more details about
          the past jobs and skills that are listed on your resume. It is
          strongly advised to use a cover letter template matching your resume
          template for an optimal application. Get a professional resume
          template here, to go with your cover letter. Note that a cover letter
          for a resume can also work for a CV—here's a selection of professional
          CV templates (and here's the difference between a resume and a CV).

          be. You can create a cover letter for the job of your dreams in

          <span class="v239_424">How do I format a cover letter?</span>
          <span class="v239_425">
            While formatting a cover letter is not as complicated as finding the
            best resume format, you still need to follow the expected cover
            letter etiquette. Typically, cover letters are formatted with a lot
            of empty space on the page (double spaces between paragraphs),
            left-aligned text, and sufficient margins. For more tips, read our
            guide on how to format a cover letter the right way.

          <span class="v239_428">
            Although resumes can be sent without a covering letter, every
            recruiter prefers to receive one to have more options and details.
            Cover letters are not always necessary or read, but they are a
            serious advantage in case other candidates didn't send one. Besides,
            a professional cover letter shows your motivation and allows you to
            say more about your projects and abilities. By sending a cover
            letter with your resume in 2023, you gain an advantage over your
            competitors.
