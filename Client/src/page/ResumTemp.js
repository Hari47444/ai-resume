        <span class="v93_664 grbody">
          A resume is a brief document with a collection of achievements in
          professional, academic, and personal areas that serves to represent
          you in a job hunt—a formal display of opportunities you've taken for a
          better future. It showcases your skill set and experience to a
          prospective employer. A resume is typically formatted into sections
          and sent alongside a cover letter.
